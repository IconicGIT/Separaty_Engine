## Description

Separaty Engine is a game engine made in C++ for learning purposes. 

This project has been created by UPC-CITM students in our 3rd year of degree Video Game Design and Development offered by the CITM. Year where we find the engine subject, subject in which this project is carried out. A project that is developed with the objective of improving our programming skills to be more efficient and clean. 

For doing it, we have focused in the basic internal tools, functions and processes that we normally do not take into account during the development of a videogame.  

It is important to highlight that our engine is free to use and everyone can give us feedback to continue improving it!

Obviously, we believe that this is not necessary to emphasize, but we will say it anyway:                   **This Engine will be Better than Unity one day!**

## Coming soon...!
