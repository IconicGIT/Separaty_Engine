## Description

Separaty Engine is a game engine made in C++ for learning purposes. 

This project has been created by UPC-CITM students in our 3rd year of the Video Game Design and Development degree offered by the CITM, year where we find the videogame engines subject, in which this project is carried out. A project that is developed with the objective of improving our programming skills to be more efficient and clean. 

In order to do so, we have focused in the basic internal tools, functions and processes that we normally do not take into account during the development of a videogame. It is for this reason that we have had to learn and develop internal and basic aspects such as game object management, rendering, structures... 

It is important to highlight that our engine is free to use and everyone can give us feedback to continue improving it!

Obviously, we believe that this is not necessary to emphasize, but we will say it anyway:           
**This Engine will be Better than Unity one day!**
