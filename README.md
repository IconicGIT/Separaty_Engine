# Separaty Engine

![Separaty-WORD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73245381/198894291-2466b7b4-0d6c-4ee8-8536-7dc6e690152b.png)

## Description

Separaty Engine is a game engine made in C++ for learning purposes. 

This project has been created by UPC-CITM students with the objective of improving our programming skills to be more efficient and clean. For doing it, we have focused in the basic internal tools, functions and processes that we normally do not take into account during the development of a videogame.  

It is important to highlight that our engine is free to use and everyone can give us feedback to continue improving it!

Obviously, we believe that this is not necessary to emphasize, but we will say it anyway:                   **This Engine will be Better than Unity one day!**

### Window

In the windows section you can find all the Editor Windows that can be used to working in the Project.  

![Window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73245381/206082227-3ac99ed4-2956-4740-bf4d-3118755b102a.png)

In this window we can find all the Game Objects created in the scene. So we can see how many objects we have and their hierarchy.

In addition to the functionalities of adding childs and removing objects.

In the inspector window you can find all the components that each object in the scene has. As it can be seen in the images, each object ha:

An information window about it

A transform window to move the object around the scene

A mesh window to change his mesh 

A texture window to texturize it.

In addition to having an extra component if we have selected a camera type game object.

![Camera](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73245381/206739055-467e31f7-db93-43b9-9a56-ff84ab2c55c9.PNG)

In this component you can modify both the near and far planes of the frustum, in addition to the FOV of the camera.

As well as allowing interaction through cameras, since it allows you to choose the view port once you are in game mode. This is done by first selecting the option to set the camera as main camera and later selecting the use camera option, in order to indicate that you want to have its point of view.

once it has been imported. Also, taking into account the duplication of the imported models, since it does not allow it. 

We have also implemented a currently non-functional folder explorer that is commented out in the code. Simply due to problems of not detecting the fileSystem.h
